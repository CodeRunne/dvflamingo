        2. Graphic design for business-
            If you ask small business owners what is the most important thing for their business, you will hear a variety of different answers such as: good service, quality goods, cheap prices, connections and so on. If you ask the same question to owners of large companies, chains and large businesses, their answers will be more unambiguous and they will all focus around marketing, branding and positioning. Let's talk a little about graphic design for business.
            The reason for this is that in any field that a business owner chooses to enter, however professional he may be, he will enter a very tough competitive market. The competition will of course be good for him mainly from the point of view of improving and upgrading the business all the time but on the other hand it will make it difficult for the business to grow and really succeed as he planned at the beginning.
            Therefore, the most experienced marketers know exactly how to beat the competition without competing with them. The answer to that is

## Faqs
    ### What is link building?
    Link building is a well-known and successful seo strategy, in which you create and collect external links from other websites leading to your website.

    When Google's algorithm detects that a certain site has received many links from other high-quality sites, its value in the eyes of Google increases. The site is seen as authoritative in its field and is recommended by various parties, therefore Google is expected to rank it in high positions and on the initial pages of the search results.

    Beyond that, external links help increase traffic to the website. The more sites that post links to your site, the greater the chance that many surfers will click on the same link and you will enjoy extremely high traffic.

    So how do you get these external links? There are two ways to do this: buying links as well as exchanging links.

    ### What is buying links?
    Buying links is actually the purchase of external links from other websites that will lead to your website.

    The act of buying links has many advantages: buying links allows you to save time and energy.

    Unlike exchanging links which requires hours of work and a lot of patience, buying links takes only a few minutes. So if you are engaged in website promotion and digital marketing, you can shorten the work processes for the promotion of the clients' websites.

    Of course, business owners can also profit greatly from buying links. By buying links you will be able to quickly improve your ranking in Google and thus get more inquiries from potential customers, expand your customer base and increase your income.


    ### Lead = potential customer.
            Broadly speaking, a lead is a potential customer who has expressed interest in your service or product directly or indirectly.
            For example - a person who saw your advertisement on Facebook and left details in the Lid form, is called in the professional language "Lid".
            Another example - a client who came to you for business, a person who received a recommendation from one of your clients, that person is a "next".

            In fact, leads are the growth engine of businesses, especially when it comes to businesses that are based on growth through the sale of services/products and need new customers on a regular basis
